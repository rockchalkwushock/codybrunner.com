description: I used a Magic Mouse for years and up until the boneheaded idea to put the charging port on the bottom of the Magic Mouse 2 I was more than happy with it. I never wanted to change mice because I would miss the gestures that Apple has built into macOS that the Magic Mouse takes advantage of. The MX Master 3 can do it all though and it has been a game changer.
