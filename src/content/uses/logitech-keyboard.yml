description: As with the Magic Mouse I used the Magic Keyboard for years. I wanted to try a different keyboard and my only requirement was for it to have low profile keys. I am not a fan of the mechanical keyboards with huge keys. Feels like my fingers are doing the tire drills from football practice. This keyboard has been great.
