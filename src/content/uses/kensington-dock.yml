description: I have another MBP that is for work and it has been a real pain in the ass...and I am talking first world pain in the ass to unplug all the cables and swap machines into my at home setup. This dock is a real banger. I have my personal monitor and work monitor plugged in as well as the dongles for the mouse and keyboard. Everything runs through the one Thunderbolt 4 cable to whichever MBP is plugged in.
