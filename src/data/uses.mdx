I love my iMac and no I give no shits that I got it right before the new Apple Silicon Macs showed up. It will last me for awhile and I'm good with it. I upgraded it to 64GB of RAM so yeah she's a beast...and yes it's a she her name is Thelma.

I freaking love my monitor and was so happy to go back to having two screens after a year of working from make shift setups and unable to get the things I wanted/needed to be more comfortable in my work.

The desk and chair from Autonomous AI are amazing! The only thing that wasn't was putting the desk together by myself and the shipping cost to Colombia. Worth every penny though!

Living in Colombia I won't say that we lose power all the time, but it does happen more frequently than it did in the USA. For that reason I bought two APC UPS backups. One for the router and one for my iMac (could we get a battery supply in these please???). The internet rarely goes down and with the backups I can get over 6 hours before we lose internet and anywhere from 40-70 minutes of extra juice for my iMac depending on the load of the machine.

I never have and never will pay for more internal storage in a Mac. I don't do video editing or any other data heavy work so the base line 500GB is perfectly fine. I do try to take backups regularly and for that I got one of these super handy T5 drives from Samsung. I also picked up the SanDisk on a pretty good firesale. They are portable and really reliable.

I had a pair of Sennheiser's for years that finally bit the dust in 2021 and a pair of Apple AirPod Pros that also bit the dust. I replaced them with both of the Anker headphones and they are fantastic. The Liberty 3 Pro's are I would beg to say are better than the AirPod Pros.

The Thule bag is perfect for traveling with all my computing gear and plenty of room for a jacket or anything else that I might need...if I ever travel again.

When I am not at my computer my wife can tell you I am in the backyard smoking or grilling. Back in my younger days I worked for a barbecue restaurant and ever since I wanted my own smoker. I love doing some beef spare ribs, smoked beer can chicken, or brisket.

I made the obvious move to whiskey after years of beer and 2 years of more craft beer than you can shake a stick at while living in Portland, Oregon. I am a big fan of Glenlivet.
