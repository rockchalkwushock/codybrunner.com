We developers tend to be very specific and attached to our setups and all the bells and whistles we use in our daily lives (work and play). In this post I will list and show off my setup along with links to the items I use and why I prefer them. If you have any recommendations or questions please feel free to reach out!

I love my iMac and no I give no shits that I got it right before the new Apple Silicon Macs showed up. It will last me for awhile and I'm good with it. I upgraded it to 64GB of RAM so yeah she's a beast...and yes it's a she her name is Thelma.

Honestly wasn't expecting to get an M1 from work and I like how snappy it is and I really like the 13" profile. Needs more RAM (I would opt for one of those 14" M1 Pros if it were me) and honestly it's not impressive enough for me to want an M1 any time soon.

I freaking love my monitor and was so happy to go back to having two screens after a year of working from make shift setups and unable to get the things I wanted/needed to be more comfortable in my work.

The desk and chair from Autonomouse are freaking amazing! The only thing that wasn't was putting the desk together by myself and the shipping cost to Colombia. Worth every penny though!

Living in Colombia I won't say that we lose power all the time, but it does happen more frequently than it did in Oregon or Kansas. For that reason I bought two APC UPS backups. One for the router and one for my iMac (could we get a battery supply in these please???). The internet rarely goes down and with the backups I can get over 2 hours before we lose internet and anywhere from 40-70 minutes of extra juice for my iMac depending on the load of the machine.

I never have and never will pay for more internal storage in a Mac. I don't do video editing or any other data heavy work so the base line 500GB is perfectly fine. I do try to take backups regularly and for that I got one of these super handy T5 drives from Samsung. They are portable and really reliable.

I had a pair of Sennheiser's for years that finally bit the dust in 2021 and a pair of Apple AirPod Pros that also bit the dust. I replaced them with both of the Anker headphones and they are fantastic. The Liberty Air Pro's are not as good as the AirPod Pros in sound quality, but those damn AirPods are fragile as fuck and were too damn expensive for them to be that poorly built so yeah I'd never buy those again.

The Thule bag is perfect for traveling with all my computing gear and plenty of room for a jacket or anything else that I might need...if I ever travel again.

## Software
