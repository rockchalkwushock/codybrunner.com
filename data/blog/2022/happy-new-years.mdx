It's hard to believe that 2021 is over. It feels as though 2021 was the blink of an eye after 2020 felt like 10 years, but here we are the first day of 2022. I don't have a hangover unless you count not sleeping because I was back in Afghanistan with all the fireworks that were going off all the way to 0600 this morning. Colombians don't fuck around when it comes to fireworks.

## Looking Back On 2021

This was really not what I expected. I had a lot of plans and grandiose views of what I was going to do and accomplish in 2021. I did none of it. It was a year of epic shit show after epic shit show. I lost my job and spent 7 months unemployed. You would think that 7 months would give me plenty of time to accomplish things, but the first 3 months were running like crazy to get a visa approved. We moved twice, albeit in the same city. My wife had some health problems that put us on red alert.

I did manage, after the pain in the ass that is finding a job in the tech industry, to land a job with a Colombian company based out of Medellin, [Leant Tech](https://www.leangroup.com/solutions/leantech). It's been a very big change in style and size compared to my last job.

One thing I am proud of is having achieve my first AWS certification at the end of the year. I have not busted my ass that hard when it comes to studying since I failed Chemistry 1 in college. I am officially a Cloud Practitioner! I am studying for the Solutions Architect Associate exam and hope to take in in 1 to 2 weeks from the time of writing.

## Looking Forward To 2022

I am going to do things slightly different than I have in the past and break my year into sections and not bite off more than I can chew in a section. Professionally speaking I want to move out of the front end to more full-stack and backend related roles and even more so out of the JavaScript ecosystem. I am completely burnt out on JavaScript and the ridiculous speed at which that ecosystem goes in circles. I am going to do more [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) development as well as learn the basics of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I am also going to continue on the path of the AWS certifications. At the time of writing I think I am only going to go as far as the second tier and not go for the professional level certifications. The fun thing about this has been better understanding the DevOps side of the web. I am kind of geeking on that shit. Personally speaking my Spanish is still complete **shit** (hey but I know that one!). If I am being honest I've been a pretty shit husband too. Our first year of marriage has been a roller coaster. I don't think either of us thought it would be the way it was. I am going to set aside more time from keyboard (**gasp sacrilege!**) and be more present with her. I also want to travel more within Colombia. I don't see myself traveling outside of Colombia anytime soon unless a job takes me out of here due to all the crazy Rona shit still going on. Most all of my co-workers at Lean Tech live in Medellin so early on this year I am going to make a trip and go work in the office...in person...for the first time in a year!
